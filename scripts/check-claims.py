"""Fails the shipped page on a phrase the project cannot back today.

This is a filter, not a proof. It matches a list of known wordings; a false claim written in
different words, a synonym, a superlative, a wrong number the corpus does not pin, or any
sentence that is merely unbacked all pass it. What it does guarantee is narrower and still
worth having: those known wordings do not appear, even when the page wraps them across lines or
encodes the characters as HTML entities.

Each entry below pairs a phrase the page must not carry with the reason it must not, and with a
sample that has to match it. The reasons are not this script's opinion: every one of them is a
claim the research record already checked and found false or unbacked, and the sample is what
keeps a pattern from quietly matching nothing — a check whose patterns are dead and a check that
scans no file both report a clean page, which is the failure this file exists to catch.

The scan normalises what it reads before it matches: inline markup (spans, links, comments)
is removed without a trace, so a phrase split by a tag is still the same phrase; `script` and
`style` elements are skipped whole, so the rendered page's framework runtime never scans as
prose; block markup
leaves a single space, so a phrase ending one block and starting the next is two phrases, not
one written across a boundary. Entities are decoded, unicode dashes become hyphens, and runs of whitespace (including the line breaks the
page wraps at) collapse to a single space. A phrase that only looks absent because it happened to
wrap, or because a hyphen was written as `&#45;`, would otherwise pass.

Run from anywhere; the repository root is resolved from this file's location. Arguments are paths
(files or directories) to scan instead of the whole checkout.

    scripts/check-claims.py              # every *.html in the checkout
    scripts/check-claims.py .tmp/empty   # reaches no file: that is a failure, not a pass

Exit 0 when the page is clean of every known wording, 1 when it carries one, 2 when the check
itself cannot run (a dead pattern, or nothing to scan).
